# Enflame Wiki

A self-hosted internal knowledge base that fuses **Karpathy's LLM-Wiki idea**
("Stop Retrieving. Start Compiling.") with **Obsidian's user experience** — and
keeps a real multi-user permission and review workflow underneath.

Three layers, in the spirit of Karpathy's setup:

- **Raw layer** (`raw/`) — immutable input documents (PDFs, markdown, images).
- **Schema layer** (`config/agents.md`) — a markdown playbook injected into the
  agent's context for every ingest and lint pass.
- **Wiki layer** (`vault/` + Postgres) — the compiled, cross-linked knowledge
  base humans and agents collaboratively curate through draft → review →
  publish.

External LLM clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, …) attach via the
**Model Context Protocol** using a personal token, and operate as the human
user whose token they hold — no separate "agent users".

## What's in the box

- **Web app** — three-pane workspace (file tree · tabbed graph/page view · chat).
- **Tabs · quick switcher · file-tree toolbar · right-click context menus** —
  Obsidian-style navigation throughout.
- **Knowledge graph** — 2D and 3D force-directed views. Live tunable via the
  Graph Settings panel: node size, edge thickness, glow, repel/center/link
  forces, link distance, per-category colors. Drag a node and its neighbors
  follow the spring chain.
- **Plexus / video background** — animated cosmic background with parallax
  rotation tied to graph dragging.
- **Roles + review queue** — reader / contributor / editor / admin. Page
  stability levels (open / stable / locked) gate auto-publish vs. queue.
- **Personal MCP tokens** — connect Claude Desktop / Cursor / etc. to the wiki
  as yourself. Drafts created via MCP route through the existing review queue.
- **Raw → agent → wiki ingest** — drop a PDF or markdown source into the
  Sources panel, click Ingest. Two-phase pipeline:
  1. **Plan** — the agent reads the source, the playbook, and a retrieval
     context, then proposes a structured set of edits with rationale,
     confidence, and source excerpts.
  2. **Apply** — you preview the plan, untick what you don't want, and approve.
     Drafts land in the existing review queue with `force_review=True` (agent
     edits never auto-publish, even on `stability=open` pages). Apply is
     idempotent and retryable; partial failures are recoverable.
- **Reviewer feedback loop** — when an agent draft is rejected, an optional
  reason category + free-text note is captured for future ingest prompts.
- **Lint pipeline** — admin-triggered audit pass: orphans, broken links,
  contradictions, stale claims, source drift. Read-only report; humans act on
  findings via Suggest-edit or Dismiss.
- **Two chat modes** in the right pane:
  - **Sources** — chunk-level RAG, line-range citations.
  - **Wiki** — synthesizes from full pages, follows `[[wikilinks]]` 1-hop,
    cites pages.
- **Markdown export** — `scripts/git-export.sh` mirrors current published state
  to disk for git commit.
- **Local embeddings** — `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` runs inside
  the backend container. No second API key needed for retrieval.

## Quickstart

You need **Docker** + **Docker Compose** + an **Anthropic API key** with credit.
Nothing else on your host.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamdeng3244/LLM-WIKI.git
cd LLM-WIKI
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… (required for chat + ingest + lint).
docker compose up --build
```

Then:

- Open <http://localhost:3000>.
- The app starts in **stub auth mode** — you're auto-logged in as admin.
- Use the role switcher in the top-right to view as a different role.
- The seed pages from `vault/` are imported on first boot.
- Try suggesting an edit, reviewing it, asking the chat panel a question, or
  uploading a markdown file in the Sources panel and clicking Ingest.

First boot of the backend container downloads the embedding model
(`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~90 MB) into the container's torch cache. Subsequent
boots reuse it. If you `docker compose down -v` it'll re-download.

## Connecting Claude Desktop / Claude Code via MCP

The wiki ships a built-in MCP server so any MCP-capable LLM client can attach
and operate on the wiki as you. This is how an "agent" in this system actually
works — not as a wiki-internal user, but as an external client authenticated
with your personal token.

1. In the web app, click the **Plug** icon in the topbar.
2. Click **Create token**, paste a name (e.g. *"Claude Desktop on laptop"*).
3. Copy the **config snippet** the modal shows you. It looks like:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "enflame-wiki": {
         "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer wt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Open your MCP client config and merge that block in:
   - **Claude Desktop** (macOS): `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Claude Desktop** (Windows): `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Cursor**: settings → Tools & Integrations → MCP servers
5. Restart the client. The wiki's tools (`search_wiki`, `get_page`,
   `list_backlinks`, `list_my_drafts`, `list_review_queue`, `create_draft`, …)
   become available.

**Permissions still apply.** A token authorizes as you. If you're a
`contributor`, `create_draft` works but the draft routes through normal
review. If you're a `reader`, write tools return 403.

The token is shown **once**. If you lose it, revoke it and create a new one.
Admin can globally disable MCP via `MCP_ENABLED=false` in `.env`, or revoke
per-user access from the same modal.

## Using the wiki day to day

### Reading + searching

- **Page tabs** — Ctrl/Cmd+T for a new tab; Ctrl/Cmd+W to close. Tabs persist
  across reloads. Right-click a file in the tree → *Open in new tab*.
- **Quick switcher** — Ctrl/Cmd+O. Fuzzy-find any page; recently opened
  surfaces first.
- **Search** — Ctrl/Cmd+K opens a chunk-level search dropdown.
- **Chat panel** (right side):
  - **Sources mode** — chunk-level RAG with line-range citations, best for
    *"where is X documented?"* questions.
  - **Wiki mode** — synthesizes from full pages, follows `[[wikilinks]]`,
    cites pages, best for *"explain this concept"* questions.

### Authoring

- **Suggest edit** (Ctrl/Cmd+E) — opens the propose dialog; submits a draft
  through the review pipeline.
- **Right-click a page tab's kebab menu** for: Backlinks toggle (inline panel),
  Copy path, Open version history, Export to PDF, Reveal in tree, etc.
- **File-tree toolbar** has 6 controls: New note, New folder (creates a
  user-folder placeholder), Sort A↔Z, Collapse/Expand all, 2D Graph, 3D Graph.
- **Custom folders** are user-created top-level categories that persist to
  localStorage; right-click to rename or delete (only if empty).

### Reviewing

- The **Review queue** modal (Inbox icon) shows every revision waiting on you.
- Open a revision → Diff / Preview / Raw view. Comments and decisions go through
  Accept / Request changes / Reject.
- **Agent-authored drafts** show an extra panel with confidence, source quotes
  with locations, conflict notes, and an optional reject-reason dropdown so
  the system can learn from your rejections.

### Uploading + ingesting

- **Sources** modal (Files icon, top bar) — drop PDFs, markdown, plain text,
  images (≤ 50 MB).
- Click **Ingest** on a source. The first time will surface a "this source
  goes to the configured LLM provider" notice. Confirm.
- The plan modal shows up. Untick what you don't want. Approve.
- Drafts land in the Review queue.
- Re-ingest of a source warns about pending drafts and supersedes any
  in-flight plan.

### Linting (admin)

- **ShieldCheck** icon in the topbar (admin-only) → Lint panel.
- Click **Run lint**. The agent reads the wiki + playbook and reports orphans,
  broken links, contradictions, stale claims, and source drift.
- Each issue can be opened on its affected page, suggest-edited, or dismissed
  with an optional note.

### Editing the playbook (admin)

- **BookText** icon in the topbar opens the playbook editor (`config/agents.md`).
- Read-only for non-admins; admin can edit + save. The file is mounted into
  the backend container; updates take effect on the next ingest or lint pass.

External LLM clients ──MCP─▶ FastAPI /mcp ──▶ wiki tools
```

Five services in `docker-compose.yml`: `db`, `redis`, `backend`, `worker`,
`frontend`. Three host bind mounts: `./vault → /vault` (wiki content
mirror), `./raw → /raw` (raw input documents), `./config → /config` (agent
playbook).

## Permission model

| Role          | Read | Draft | Comment | Review (in-cat) | Lock | Manage |
|---------------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|
| reader        |  ✓   |       |         |                 |      |        |
| contributor   |  ✓   |   ✓   |   ✓     |                 |      |        |
| editor        |  ✓   |   ✓   |   ✓     |       ✓         |      |        |
| admin         |  ✓   |   ✓   |   ✓     |       ✓         |  ✓   |   ✓    |

Each page has a **stability level**:

- **open** — drafts auto-publish on submit (low-stakes).
- **stable** — drafts go to the review queue (default).
- **locked** — only admins can publish.

**Agent-authored drafts always force-review**, even on `stability=open` pages.
The trust dial is for humans only.

Editors are scoped per-category. See `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` for the detailed
reference.

## What's stubbed (production TODO)

- **Auth**: OIDC scaffold exists but `/auth/callback` and Authlib wiring need
  finishing for real OIDC. Stub mode is the default.
- **Migrations**: schema is created via `Base.metadata.create_all` plus inline
  ALTER statements in `app/main.py:lifespan`. Replace with Alembic before
  production.
- **File watcher**: external edits to `vault/` are imported only on startup.
- **Reranker**: retrieval uses cosine distance only. A cross-encoder reranker
  would meaningfully improve answer quality.
- **Code-aware chunking**: paragraph-level + regex-based code-block detection.
  Tree-sitter would be more accurate.
- **Email**: in-app notifications work; SMTP/SES not wired.
- **Rate limiting**: chat / ingest / lint endpoints are unprotected. Add Redis
  per-user limits before opening to many users.
- **Observability**: no metrics or tracing. Wire OpenTelemetry → Prometheus →
  Grafana for production.
- **Backups**: document Postgres backup strategy and test restore.
- **Tests**: a test directory exists but tests aren't written; smoke tests for
  the workflow state machine are highest priority.
